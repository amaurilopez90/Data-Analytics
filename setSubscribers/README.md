# Description
Reads in csv files containing subscriber information to a magazine which includes a subscriber name and a subscriber ID number 

  1. Stores this information into a subscriber object and creates a set of subscribers for that file
  2. The program can then perform **Union**, **Intersection**, and **Cartesian Product** functions on two sets
  
# Known Limitations
  1. Importing CSV files of thousands of elements may take a while
  2. Printing out a set of thousands of elements may also take a while depending on the size of the CSV
  
# Planned Improvements
  1. Adding functionality to write results to new CSV file
